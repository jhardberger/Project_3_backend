# Mapulate #
## (back-end) ##

Mapulate is a full-stack app that helps users learn about U.S. city and state populations. It was built with the the Google Maps React API and data from the U.S. census API. 

In "practice" mode, a user can:
	-click or use a search bar to navigate a map of the U.S. 
	-see the populations of various regions, cities, etc. 

In "game" mode, a user can:
	-put their knowledge to the test with several quizes and question types.

**This app is not currently deployed**, but if you'd like to see how it works, you can clone this repo and the front-end repo, courtesy of my collaborator/classmate Chris Lehman: https://github.com/LehmanBrother/Project-3 (there's also a little more info about the project on Chris's page).
